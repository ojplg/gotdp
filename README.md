Learning some Python. Learning some Django.

This is my first attempt. Still in a very early stage.

The application is a Game of Thrones Death Pool. Users can make
predictions about which characters will live and which will die.

# TODO

* Figure out how to make html containers and includes
* Navigation for the pages
* Add a page that shows the voting totals so far
* Add all the characters
* CSS for all the pages
* Home page layout improvements
* Better selection form
* Figure out why capitalization of names on form is fucked up
* Rules for how the pool is settled
* Fix many-to-many relationship between selection and selections: should by one-to-many
* Score keeping
* Coupling predictions
